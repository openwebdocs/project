# Steering Committee Membership Expectations

This document describes the rights, responsibilities, and expected behaviors of individuals serving on the Open Web Docs steering committee. As an openly governed project, we use these membership expectations to establish clear guidelines for participation.

The OWD Steering Committee is expected to reflect and build upon the needs and concerns of a globally diverse community of web developers. It is expected that this body will work to mirror that diversity in its membership.

## Rights & Benefits
Individuals participate in the steering committee on behalf of an organization, or representing a community of practice (one individual per organization/community, with an alternate to facilitate continuity).
- They provide feedback on OWD priority work areas
- They provide feedback on OWD’s editorial direction
- They propose improvements or new work streams for OWD
- They review other proposals and provide feedback

## Responsibilities
- Join the steering committee calls at least once a month
- Join and participate in asynchronous discussions
- Attend at least 2 quarterly review meetings per year (quarterly review meetings will be held remotely for the time being, and may be open to the public)
- Provide feedback on editorial direction and documentation work streams
- Help promote Open Web Docs work

## Expectations
As a steering committee member, you agree to:
- Abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md)
- Participate and engage with the community in a professional and positive manner
- Actively solicit and engage with feedback on proposed work items
- Not promote a specific corporate or individual agenda, particularly during the creation, editing or prioritization of content on MDN or other OWD-supported documentation projects.
- Represent the needs of the wider diverse community of web developers
- Promptly inform Open Web Docs if your affiliation changes, as this may affect your participation on the steering committee


## Signing members

In support of these expectations,
